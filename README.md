# experiment-build-with-matlab

Final Project (Winter 2019) for Programming I: Experiment Building with MATLAB. This project `psychtoolbox` to initiate a window, display images on the screen, and record keyboard input from participants.

Participants are shown images from the [Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces](https://www.kdef.se/index.html) database of emotional faces and are asked to indicate what emotion was displayed.

Faces varied on emotion type (happy, angry, sad), orientation (side, midside, frontal), and target sex (male, female).
